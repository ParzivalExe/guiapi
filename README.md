With GuiAPI you can create Guis for your Bukkit/Spigot-Plugin in seconds while at the same time saving many lines of code

**Important**: GuiAPI is right now only interesting for Developers to use as an API. As a Server-Admin this Plugin is useless as it doesn't work without use in code. It could of course be used by other plugins you are using in which case it is necessary to run these Plugins.


## I simply need the API because another Plugin uses it

**Don't panic** ðŸ˜‰. In this case it is pretty easy and you don't need to bother with all the other stuff written in this Readme. 
Simply navigate to (CurseForge.com)[https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/guiapi-by-birdcraft33/files] and download the Version of GuiAPI that corresponds to your Minecraft-Version. 



## Implementation

There are different ways to implement this API into your Code so that you can use it's functionality properly

### Through .jar-File

This is probably the way you implement most other APIs (including the Spigot/Bukkit.jar) usually. 
For this, you can download the GuiAPI [at CurseForge.com](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/guiapi-by-birdcraft33/files). 
Just make sure, that you download the Version approved for the Minecraft-Version you are developing for.
